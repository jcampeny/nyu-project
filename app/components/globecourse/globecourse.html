				<p>This section contains the basic materials required to teach an introductory course on the implications of globalization for businesses and those who lead them.  The materials are based on a 12-session course, the Globalization of Business Enterprise (GLOBE), developed by Pankaj Ghemawat for the first year of the MBA program at IESE Business School.</p>
				<p>The GLOBE course was developed and refined during the term of Ghemawat’s membership of the AACSB taskforce on the globalization of business education. Chapter 4 from the report issued by that taskforce, Globalization of Management Education: Changing International Structures, Adaptive Strategies, and the Impact on Institutions (Emerald, 2011), provides a detailed discussion of how GLOBE’s design responds to the imperatives identified by the taskforce. But in brief, GLOBE responds to the need identified by academic thought leaders for a course that introduces students of business to a framework for thinking broadly but systematically about the differences between countries. It is not a course on international macroeconomics nor tailored to a particular functional area.  More specifically, this section contains:<br/>Documents (syllabus, assignment questions, supplemental resources, chapter from AACSB report, etc.)<br/>Selected Readings (for students)<br/>Selected Cases (for students; note other cases on syllabus are available from Harvard Business School Publishing)<br/>Additionally, the following materials are available for instructors only by e-mail to globecourse@ghemawat.com:</p>
				<p>Teaching Notes<br/>Powerpoint Presentations (for in-class use)<br/>Updated materials will be added to this website as they become available.</p>
				<p>For permission to use these materials to deliver or a course or to sign up for automatic notification of the availability of new/updated materials please e-mail globecourse@ghemawat.com.</p>
